# Chakra UI Nuxt Next - Starter

This repo is a starter template for the next version of Chakra UI Vue v1. v1 was rewriten from the ground up with the following new features:
- TS support
- Powered by UI state machines
- Improved theming API design. You can see the `theme` to see the new theming API usage
- Semantic Tokens
- More low-level hooks and composables


> Chakra UI Vue Next is under heavy active development. Whereas this beta is testable, some internal changes may occur.
> If you're building something critical, I do not recommend using it in production yet. Unless of course you're bold and fearless. :D
> In any case, if you've got questions, please DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codebender828).
